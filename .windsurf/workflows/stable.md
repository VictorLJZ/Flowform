description: Running build and fixing errors
---

Ok, can you bun run build and fix the errors? Before you start fixing, categorize all the errors, and consider ways to fix multiple in one stroke. Understand the errors before you fix them. Do not use band-aid fixes. Do not use type assertions. If there are type errors, check @src/types to see if we already have them, or similar types. If not, create new types in that folder. Use best practices. Do not try any tricks with disabling linting or disabling build errors.
