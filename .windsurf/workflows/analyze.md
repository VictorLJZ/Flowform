description: Deeply analyze a problem
---

Do not edit any code yet. Do not assume anything. Deeply analyze this problem, and do not stop analyzing until you can tell me why in simple terms. Look for disconnects, or discrepancies. Consider the micro and macro of the problem. Keep analyzing files until you have a comprehensive understanding of the whole system, and can explain to me clearly.
