# Workspace Isolation Analysis

This document analyzes the current state of workspace isolation in FlowForm and provides recommendations for improvement.

## Database-Level Security (RLS Policies)

**Current Status**: Partial Implementation

### Strong Points
- Workspaces table has proper RLS policies for all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Forms table has RLS to ensure workspace-scoped access
- Most join tables have appropriate workspace-based filtering
- Permission checks are enforced at database level for core tables

### Missing Patterns
- Some analytics tables appear to lack workspace-specific RLS policies
- Form response tables need stronger workspace-based policies
- Some tables with workspace_id foreign keys don't have explicit RLS preventing cross-workspace access
- No consistent pattern for automatically enforcing workspace boundaries across all tables

## SWR Fetchers

**Current Status**: Inconsistent Implementation

### Strong Points
- `useCurrentWorkspace` and `useWorkspaces` hooks properly manage workspace state
- Authentication is well-integrated with workspace access
- SWR key naming follows good practices
- Data fetching is tied to authentication state

### Missing Patterns
- No centralized workspace context pattern for consistent access
- Inconsistent workspace ID injection across different fetch operations
- No standardized pattern for automatically including workspace context in all data fetches
- Potential for developers to forget workspace filtering in new fetchers

## API Routes

**Current Status**: Manual Implementation

### Strong Points
- Permission checking API (`/api/permissions/workspace`) validates workspace access
- Some API endpoints appear to validate workspace access
- Authentication middleware is properly implemented

### Missing Patterns
- No middleware for automatic workspace validation across all routes
- Manual workspace ID validation in each route
- Potential for bypassing workspace validation if a developer forgets to check
- Inconsistent error handling for unauthorized workspace access

## Overall Architecture

The current architecture uses a "manual check" approach rather than an "automatic enforcement" approach, which has several implications:

### Strong Points
- Flexible implementation that allows for custom logic when needed
- Authentication is well-integrated with the system
- Core workspace isolation exists for critical tables

### Missing Patterns
- No "fail-safe" default that prevents cross-workspace access
- Relies on developer discipline to maintain isolation
- Risk of regression as new features are added
- No centralized management of workspace context

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Complete Database RLS**: Add missing RLS policies to ensure database-level security
2. **Create Workspace API Middleware**: Add a consistent pattern for API routes to validate workspace access
3. **Standardize Fetchers**: Create a wrapper for SWR that automatically includes workspace context
4. **Implement Workspace Context**: Consider a context provider for consistent workspace access

These improvements would establish multiple layers of protection against cross-workspace data access while minimizing code changes to the existing architecture.
