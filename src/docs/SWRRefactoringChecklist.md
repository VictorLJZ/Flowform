# SWR Workspace Isolation Refactoring Checklist

This document lists the hooks that were refactored to use our new workspace-aware SWR utilities.

## Hooks That Definitely Needed Refactoring - COMPLETED ✅

These hooks use SWR and handle workspace-related data directly:

- [x] `/src/hooks/useCurrentWorkspace.ts` - Now uses workspace-aware SWR
- [x] `/src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - Now uses workspace-aware SWR
- [x] `/src/hooks/useForms.ts` - Now uses workspace-aware SWR
- [x] `/src/hooks/useWorkspaceMembers.ts` - Now uses workspace-aware SWR
- [x] `/src/hooks/useWorkspaces.ts` - Enhanced with better patterns (uses standard SWR since it fetches all workspaces for a user)
- [x] `/src/hooks/useAnalyticsData.ts` - Enhanced with better patterns (doesn't need workspace-aware SWR since it's already filtered by form ID)
- [x] `/src/hooks/useVersionedAnalyticsData.ts` - Migrated from useEffect to SWR for consistent patterns
- [x] `/src/hooks/useVersionedForm.ts` - Migrated from useEffect to SWR for consistent patterns
- [x] `/src/hooks/useForm.ts` - Enhanced with better patterns (doesn't need workspace-aware SWR since it's already filtered by form ID)

## Hooks That May Need Refactoring - VERIFIED ✅

These hooks have been evaluated and determined to NOT need workspace-aware SWR refactoring:

- [x] `/src/hooks/analytics/useBlockInteractionTracking.ts` - No SWR usage, client-side tracking only
- [x] `/src/hooks/analytics/useBlockViewTracking.ts` - No SWR usage, client-side tracking only
- [x] `/src/hooks/analytics/useFormCompletionTracking.ts` - No SWR usage, client-side tracking only
- [x] `/src/hooks/analytics/useFormViewTracking.ts` - No SWR usage, client-side tracking only
- [x] `/src/hooks/form/useFormAnswers.ts` - Client-side only using localStorage, no SWR
- [x] `/src/hooks/form/useFormSubmission.ts` - Client-side form submission, no SWR-based data fetching
- [x] `/src/hooks/useAIConversation.ts` - Already uses standard SWR with proper key namespacing
- [x] `/src/hooks/useWorkspaceInvitations.ts` - Already uses proper SWR pattern with workspace ID in key

## Hooks That Don't Need Refactoring - VERIFIED ✅

These hooks don't involve workspace data or SWR:

- [x] `/src/hooks/useAuthSession.ts` - Authentication is workspace-independent
- [x] `/src/hooks/use-mobile.ts` - UI utility, completely workspace-independent
- [x] `/src/hooks/analytics/useTimingMeasurement.ts` - Utility hook, workspace-independent
- [x] `/src/hooks/form/useFormAbandonment.ts` - Client-side utility
- [x] `/src/hooks/form/useFormNavigation.ts` - Client-side utility
- [x] `/src/hooks/useWorkspaceSwitcher.ts` - UI utility that manages workspace switching
- [x] `/src/hooks/useWorkspaceInitialization.ts` - Initialization utility

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully refactored all necessary hooks and verified that the remaining hooks don't need refactoring. The changes we've made include:

1. **Created Reusable Utilities**:
   - `useWorkspaceSWR` - A workspace-aware version of SWR
   - `createWorkspaceFetcher` - Factory for workspace-aware fetchers
   - `createWorkspaceKey` - Utility for consistent SWR key generation

2. **Applied Consistent Patterns**:
   - Consistent error handling across all data fetching hooks
   - Type safety improved throughout the codebase
   - Better naming conventions for SWR keys

3. **Improved Code Quality**:
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Enhanced hooks with additional features like better error handling
   - Migrated from useEffect-based fetching to SWR for consistency

These improvements will ensure proper workspace isolation throughout the application's data layer.

## Next Steps

With the client-side data fetching now properly handling workspace isolation, the next area to focus on is:

- API Route Middleware for workspace access validation
- Database-level Row Level Security (RLS) for additional protection
