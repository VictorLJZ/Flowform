# FlowForm-neo Analytics Implementation Guide

This document outlines the event-driven approach for implementing analytics in the FlowForm-neo application.

## Event-Driven Analytics Architecture

### 1. Event Sources

**Frontend Events:**
- Form view events
- Block visibility events
- User interaction events (focus, blur, change)
- Form submission events
- Error events

**Backend Events:**
- Form creation/update events
- Response creation/update events
- Dynamic block conversation events
- Authentication events

### 2. Event Processing Pipeline

#### Immediate Processing
- Insert raw events into respective tables (form_views, form_interactions)
- Update simple counters and timestamps in real-time

#### Background Processing
- Calculate aggregated metrics using scheduled jobs
- Update form_metrics and block_metrics tables periodically
- Run more complex analytics (sentiment analysis, topic extraction) asynchronously

### 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend Event Tracking**
   - Implement tracking hooks in React components
   - Create custom analytics hooks for consistent event structure
   - Add event listeners for form interactions
   - Consider debouncing for high-frequency events

2. **Backend Event Handlers**
   - Create API endpoints to receive frontend events
   - Implement database triggers for automatic metric updates
   - Set up serverless functions for processing events

3. **Supabase Implementation Details**
   - Use Supabase Edge Functions for event processing
   - Implement database triggers for maintaining aggregated tables
   - Use Row Level Security to protect analytics data

4. **Scheduled Jobs**
   - Implement daily/hourly jobs to calculate aggregate metrics
   - Update form_metrics table with latest statistics
   - Clean up old interaction data if needed

### 4. Data Flow Example

**Form View Tracking:**
1. User loads a form → Frontend sends a "form_view" event
2. Event is inserted into form_views table
3. Database trigger increments total_views in form_metrics
4. If visitor_id is new, also increment unique_views

**Form Completion Tracking:**
1. User completes a form → Frontend sends a "form_complete" event
2. Event updates form_responses.status to 'completed'
3. Database trigger increments total_completions in form_metrics
4. Scheduled job calculates updated completion_rate

### 5. Technical Considerations

**Performance:**
- Batch inserts for high-volume events
- Index tables appropriately for query performance
- Consider time-based partitioning for large tables

**Privacy:**
- Ensure no personally identifiable information in analytics data
- Use anonymous IDs consistently
- Implement data retention policies

**Maintenance:**
- Set up monitoring for the analytics pipeline
- Create admin tools to rebuild metrics if needed
- Document data dictionary for all analytics fields
