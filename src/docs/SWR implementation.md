# Potential SWR Implementation Areas

This document outlines areas in the codebase where implementing or enhancing the use of SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) could simplify data fetching, state management, and improve user experience through caching and automatic revalidation.

## 1. Analytics Data (`useAnalyticsStore`)

*   **Current:** `src/stores/analyticsStore.ts` fetches data directly within actions (`fetchResponses`, `fetchResponseById`) and manually handles loading/error states.
*   **Opportunity:** Replace manual fetching with dedicated SWR hooks:
    *   `useFormResponses(formId)`: Fetches the list of all responses for a given form.
    *   `useFormResponse(responseId)`: Fetches details of a single response.
*   **Benefit:** Leverages SWR's caching, automatic revalidation, loading/error state management, potentially simplifying or eliminating the need for the Zustand store for data holding.

## 2. Dashboard Data (`useDashboardStore`)

*   **Current:** `src/stores/dashboard-store.ts` fetches aggregated data in the `fetchDashboardData` action.
*   **Opportunity:** Move fetching logic into a dedicated SWR hook:
    *   `useDashboardData(workspaceId)`: Fetches the summary/stats data for the dashboard based on the selected workspace.
*   **Benefit:** Simplifies the store, standardizes data fetching, benefits from SWR caching.

## 3. Form Definitions

*   **Form Builder (`/dashboard/forms/builder/[formId]`):**
    *   **Opportunity:** Implement `useFormDefinition(formId)` to fetch the detailed structure of the form being edited.
    *   **Benefit:** Caching and revalidation for the form structure during editing.
*   **Public Form View (`/f/[formId]`):**
    *   **Opportunity:** Implement `usePublicFormDefinition(formId)` to fetch the form structure needed for public rendering.
    *   **Benefit:** Caching for public form views.

## 4. Other List/Detail Data

*   **Workspace Members & Invitations:**
    *   **Opportunity:** If components display lists of team members or pending invitations, use SWR hooks:
        *   `useWorkspaceMembers(workspaceId)`
        *   `useWorkspaceInvitations(workspaceId)`
    *   **Benefit:** Efficiently fetch and display potentially dynamic lists, leveraging caching.
*   **User Profile:**
    *   **Opportunity:** If detailed user profile information beyond the basic user object (fetched by `useAuthSession`) is displayed, use an SWR hook:
        *   `useUserProfile()`
    *   **Benefit:** Cache detailed user profile data.

## General Benefits of Using SWR in These Areas:

*   **Simplified State Management:** Reduces the need for manual loading and error state tracking in components or Zustand stores.
*   **Improved Performance:** Caching reduces redundant network requests.
*   **Better User Experience:** Automatic revalidation keeps data fresh without manual intervention.
*   **Code Standardization:** Consistent pattern for asynchronous data fetching across the application.
