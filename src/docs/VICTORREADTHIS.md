# Session Summary & SWR Implementation Notes

## Session Goal: Workspace Management Refactor & Renaming Debug

The primary goals of this session were to:

1.  Implement a global state for the currently selected workspace using Zustand.
2.  Ensure the Dashboard page reacts to changes in the selected workspace and fetches appropriate data.
3.  Debug and fix an issue where renaming a workspace resulted in a "User not authenticated" error.

## Key Changes & Fixes:

1.  **Global Workspace State (`useWorkspaceStore`)**:
    *   Created a Zustand store (`src/stores/workspaceStore.ts`) to manage the `currentWorkspaceId` globally.
    *   Refactored `WorkspaceSwitcher` (`src/components/dashboard/navigation/workspace-switcher.tsx`) to read the list of workspaces but set the selected `workspaceId` in the global `useWorkspaceStore`.

2.  **Dashboard Integration**:
    *   Modified `useDashboardStore` (`src/stores/dashboard-store.ts`) so its `fetchDashboardData` action accepts a `workspaceId`.
    *   Updated the main Dashboard page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to:
        *   Read `currentWorkspaceId` from `useWorkspaceStore`.
        *   Pass this ID to `fetchDashboardData` within a `useEffect` hook, ensuring data is fetched/refetched when the selected workspace changes.
        *   Use `currentWorkspaceId` with the `useCurrentWorkspace` hook to display the correct workspace name in the header and manage settings (rename, leave, delete).
        *   Resolved associated lint errors.

3.  **Workspace Renaming Debug**:
    *   **Problem:** Renaming failed with a "User not authenticated" error, despite the user being logged in.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `updateWorkspace` service function (`src/services/workspace/updateWorkspace.ts`) was creating a *new*, unauthenticated Supabase client instance (`createClient()`) instead of using the existing authenticated one provided by the `AuthProvider`. This new client lacked the necessary auth token for the Supabase RLS policy check.
    *   **Fix:**
        *   Refactored `updateWorkspace` to accept an authenticated `SupabaseClient` as its first argument. It now uses this passed-in client for the database operation.
        *   Updated the `rename` function within the `useCurrentWorkspace` hook (`src/hooks/useCurrentWorkspace.ts`) to:
            *   Import and use the `useAuth` hook (from `src/providers/auth-provider.tsx`) to access the authenticated `supabase` client instance.
            *   Pass this authenticated `client` as the first argument when calling `updateWorkspace`.
        *   Resolved subsequent lint errors related to import paths and function signatures.

## SWR Implementation Summary

We leverage SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) primarily for managing asynchronous data fetching and caching, especially around authentication and user-specific data.

1.  **Authentication (`useAuthSession`)**:
    *   The core is the `useAuthSession` hook (`src/hooks/useAuthSession.ts`).
    *   It uses `useSWR` to fetch and cache the current Supabase session (`supabase.auth.getSession()`) and user (`supabase.auth.getUser()`).
    *   **Key:** A constant string (`'authSession'`) identifies this specific cache entry.
    *   **Fetcher:** An async function that performs the Supabase `getSession` and `getUser` calls.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides loading/error states, automatic revalidation (on window focus, reconnect, interval), and ensures components accessing the session share the same cached data, reducing redundant fetches.

2.  **Integration with `AuthProvider`**:
    *   The `AuthProvider` (`src/providers/auth-provider.tsx`) sets up the main Supabase client and listens to Supabase's `onAuthStateChange` events.
    *   Critically, when an auth state change occurs (login, logout), the `AuthProvider` manually triggers a **global revalidation** of the SWR cache for the auth session using `mutate('authSession')`. This ensures the `useAuthSession` hook reflects the latest auth state immediately across the application.

3.  **Dependent Data Fetching (e.g., `useCurrentWorkspace`, `useWorkspaces`)**:
    *   Hooks that fetch user-specific data (like workspaces) often depend on `useAuthSession` to get the `user` object or `userId`.
    *   Their `useSWR` keys are typically made conditional (e.g., `key = userId ? ['workspaces', userId] : null`). Setting the key to `null` prevents SWR from fetching if the user isn't authenticated, avoiding unnecessary requests and errors.

4.  **Mutations & UI Updates**:
    *   After performing actions that modify data on the server (like renaming a workspace via `updateWorkspace`), we use the `mutate` function returned by the relevant `useSWR` hook (e.g., in `useCurrentWorkspace`).
    *   Calling `mutate()` tells SWR to re-fetch the data associated with that hook's key. This updates the local SWR cache and triggers a re-render in components using the hook, ensuring the UI reflects the changes made on the backend.

This combination of SWR for caching/revalidation and Zustand for specific global UI state (like the selected workspace ID) provides a robust pattern for managing data and state in the application.
